# Docker Images

This is to help pull docker images ahead of time to avoid having to wait for them to download when you need them.

## Usage

To generate the images, run:

```bash
bash generate_images.sh
```

## Install

To install the images, run:

```bash
bash images.sh
```

This file is generated from the `generate_images.sh` script and pulls images.

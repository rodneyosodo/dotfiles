## Disto of choice

I have previously used Ubuntu, but I have recently switched to Arch Linux. I have found that Arch Linux is much more customizable and lightweight than Ubuntu. I also like the AUR, which is a repository of user-created packages. I have found that the AUR has almost every package I need, and it is very easy to install packages from the AUR.

I have shifted to Arch Linux as my primary distro for my PC, this is because:

- I like the AUR
- I like the Arch Wiki
- Sometimes staying on the bleeding edge is fun

I will continue and forever use Debian for my servers and workstations, this is because:

- I like the stability
- I like the community

This is somehow a goodbye to Ubuntu, I feel like I have outgrown it. I started using Ubuntu 2017 and I have been using it since then. I have learned a lot from Ubuntu, and I will forever be grateful for that. After 7 years the journey has come to an end. After all, Ubuntu is the reason why I am here today.

## Desktop Environment

GNOME is my desktop environment of choice. I like the simplicity of GNOME, and I like the way it looks. GNOME extensions are also very useful, and I use a lot of them. Though it is a bit heavy, I don't mind that.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

Follow the instructions in the [Arch](archinstall.md) section.
